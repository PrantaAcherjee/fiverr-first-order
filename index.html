      <div class="first-article">Crossing the Alps have always been a journey to remember. Hannibal did it with elephants. Wealthy young aristocrats on their 18th century Grand Tour to Italy were carried over the high passes by servants. A hospice at the Great St Bernard Pass sent out rescue dogs if a traveller got lost on a glacier (no points for guessing the breed).

        Today, crossing the Swiss Alps on a mountain railway is arguably an even greater adventure (but also rather more comfortable). Your train negotiates some of the steepest gradients anywhere in the Alps, crosses deep gorges, and passes by glaciers and waterfalls that were far beyond reach for the first travellers. And your only hardship will be that maybe the glass of Gewürztraminer that the steward just served at your seat is not quite chilled to perfection.

      <div class="remaining-article">All our journeys to Switzerland include at least one – and often several – mountain railways. Some of them are legendary, others humbler. On one you can mingle at the onboard cocktail bar, while on another you may chat with local farmers and schoolchildren.</div>
